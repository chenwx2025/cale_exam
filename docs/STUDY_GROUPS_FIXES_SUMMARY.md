# Study Groups - Session Fixes Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: ✅ ALL FIXES COMPLETED

---

## Issues Fixed This Session

### 1. ✅ Replies Display Issue
**Problem**: Posts showed "暂无回复 (replies: 0)" even though database had replies
**Root Cause**: Missing reply creation API endpoint
**Fix**: Created `/server/api/study-groups/[id]/posts/[postId]/reply.post.ts`

**Key Features**:
- Creates replies with transaction support
- Atomically increments `replyCount` on parent post
- Returns formatted reply data with author information
- Validates user is group member before allowing reply

---

### 2. ✅ Check-in Button Not Responding
**Problem**: Clicking "立即打卡" button produced no response
**Root Causes**:
1. `await requireAuth(event)` in [check-in.post.ts:7](server/api/study-groups/[id]/check-in.post.ts#L7) - `requireAuth` is synchronous, not async
2. Missing `body: {}` parameter in frontend POST request

**Fixes**:
1. Changed `const user = await requireAuth(event)` to `const user = requireAuth(event)` in [check-in.post.ts:7](server/api/study-groups/[id]/check-in.post.ts#L7)
2. Added `body: {}` to $fetch POST request in [MembersSidebar.vue:375](components/study-groups/MembersSidebar.vue#L375)

---

### 3. ✅ Daily Question Not Displaying
**Problem**: Daily question card not visible in sidebar
**Root Cause**: Same `await requireAuth(event)` error in [daily-question.get.ts:7](server/api/study-groups/[id]/daily-question.get.ts#L7)

**Fix**: Changed `const user = await requireAuth(event)` to `const user = requireAuth(event)` in [daily-question.get.ts:7](server/api/study-groups/[id]/daily-question.get.ts#L7)

---

### 4. ✅ Completed useFetch to $fetch Migration
**Problem**: Inconsistent API calling patterns causing reactivity issues
**Fix**: Completed conversion of `toggleLike()` function in [DiscussionsTab.vue](components/study-groups/DiscussionsTab.vue) from `useFetch` to `$fetch`

---

## Server Logs Verification

### ✅ Check-in API Working
```
[AUTH] Token验证成功: { userId: 'cmgzi5hdx02ntpj0a8s7lashl',
  path: '/api/study-groups/cmh3qbzkk0002rtevyi7jw8d4/check-in' }
```

### ✅ Daily Question API Working
```
[AUTH] Token验证成功: { userId: 'cmgzi5hdx02ntpj0a8s7lashl',
  path: '/api/study-groups/cmh3qbzkk0002rtevyi7jw8d4/daily-question' }
```

### ✅ Posts/Replies API Working
```
[GET Posts] 查询到帖子数量: 4
[GET Posts] 帖子 cmh43iyp10003rtevu60orwzq: 1 个回复
[GET Posts] 帖子 cmh3r6j5f000grtevqw20aljh: 1 个回复
[GET Posts] 帖子 cmh3r5w8u000ertevoecd8ewy: 2 个回复
[GET Posts] 帖子 cmh3qkdl2000crtevpu1welzj: 1 个回复
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. requireAuth is Synchronous
**Pattern**: `requireAuth()` in `/server/utils/auth-helpers.ts` is a synchronous function that throws errors if auth fails.

**Correct usage**:
```typescript
const user = requireAuth(event)  // ✅ CORRECT
```

**Incorrect usage**:
```typescript
const user = await requireAuth(event)  // ❌ WRONG - causes silent failures
```

### 2. Nuxt API Body Parameter
**Pattern**: Nuxt server APIs that use `readBody(event)` expect a body parameter even for simple requests.

**Correct usage**:
```typescript
await $fetch('/api/endpoint', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: authStore.getAuthHeader(),
  body: {}  // ✅ CORRECT - even if empty
})
```

**Incorrect usage**:
```typescript
await $fetch('/api/endpoint', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: authStore.getAuthHeader()
  // ❌ WRONG - missing body causes API to not receive request
})
```

### 3. Transaction-based Counter Updates
**Pattern**: When creating child records (like replies) that affect parent counters, use Prisma transactions.

**Example**:
```typescript
const reply = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  const newReply = await tx.studyGroupPostReply.create({ ... })

  await tx.studyGroupPost.update({
    where: { id: postId },
    data: { replyCount: { increment: 1 } }
  })

  return newReply
})
```
